## Introduction:
For our final project we decided to replicate an oldschool arcade, by coding implementations of both Tetris and Snake (which are fully functional) in tiny-graphics. Players have access to both of these games, and are able to swap between them whenever they want. They also have controls that can pause, and change the speed of each game.

Tetris includes 5 unique, rotatable pieces that are spawned randomly, as well as animations when a "tetris" is completed. Additionally, we decided to add a "next-block" screen for players to know what was the next incoming shape. Finally, we added some sounds from the original tetris game.

Snake randomly generates fruits for players to eat, while making sure they do not collide with themselves, or the walls of the grid. To replicate the original feel of snake, we also implemented some classic 8-bit noises.

Both of these games are rendered on a custom `grid-renderer` class that displays the game screen in the world.



## Advanced Features:

- Collision Detection
- Animations
- Camera Transitions
- User Input
